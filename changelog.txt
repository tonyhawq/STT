  Headline:
    - Filters can be grouped and disable each other.
  Features:
    - Filters can have groups and be exclusive within that group.
    - If an exclusive filter is activated, all others disable
    - If a non-exclusive filter is activated, any enabled exclusive filters are disabled
    - This only applies to filters within a group
  Bugfixes:
    - Filters no longer have the chance to increasingly make the window bigger
    - Incorrectly typed values inside of config.json are properly caught inside of config_get_optional_property
